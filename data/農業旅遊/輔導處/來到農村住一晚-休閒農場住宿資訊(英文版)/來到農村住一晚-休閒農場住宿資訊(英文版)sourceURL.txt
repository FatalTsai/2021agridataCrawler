Our main crops include bamboo shoots, green bamboo shoots, and Chinese Bayberries. We also plant various mountain vegetables according to the season. Our crops are not only sold in the market, they are also offered to visitors for adoption. Visitors can cultivate, pick, and make their own products to enjoy the fun of ploughing and weeding with bare hands and feet and the contentment of a harvest. Every year our green bamboo shoots participate in the bamboo shoot evaluation contest of Keelung City, receiving awards almost every time. Our high quality green bamboo shoots are loved by our regular customers; whether cooked with soup or dressed cold, they can be made into a variety of delicious dishes. We welcome your orders! May is the growing season for Chinese Bayberries. This type of fruit, rich in vitamin C, is rarely seen in Taiwan; hence, the growing season is relatively short. Therefore, we advise those who are interested in Chinese Bayberries to not miss the growing season each year. We invite you to bring your children for an experience in picking Chinese Bayberries!","Coordinate":"121.6815642,25.1397107","AddrDisplay":"No.60-1, Datong St., Qidu Dist., Keelung City 20653","TelDisplay":"+886-2-24310892、+886-910-107402","FaxDisplay":"","Email":"","CountyName":"Keelung City","TownshipName":"Qidu Dist.","Image":"https://ezgo.coa.gov.tw/UploadImg/6/20151117180814.jpg","URLDisplay":"","FBUrl":"","ContactPerson":"","OpenTimeList":[]},{"ID":78,"Name":"Tian-Cai Leisure Farm","Content":"I have been engaging in agriculture at this farm for my whole life.

According to extant historical records, the ancestors of the Kavalan people traveled to Taiwan from across the sea and settled on Lanyang Plain. These settlers called themselves the Kavalan, meaning “People of the Plain.” The Kavalan, native to Yilan, prefer to gather near water. Thus, because this area is divided by the Dongshan River, Kavalan settlements are significantly more abundant in the riverside area. The Dongshan River Water Park has become one of the key attractions for travelers visiting Yilan. Dongshan River is ecologically diverse, inhabited by numerous species of resident and migratory birds. Thus, visitors can not only view numerous species of vegetation, but also engage in spectacular bird-watching activities. The Center of Traditional Arts is only a river-crossing away from the water park, combining culture and tourism in one destination. The Dongshan River Agricultural Leisure Area includes comprehensive travelling content, and we welcome you to visit us anytime.","Coordinate":"121.8104573,24.6725535","AddrDisplay":"No.120, Wuyuan 3rd Rd.,Wuyuan Vil, Dongshan Township, Yilan County 26966","TelDisplay":"+886-3-9603773","FaxDisplay":"","Email":"","CountyName":"Yilan County","TownshipName":"Dongshan Township","Image":"https://ezgo.coa.gov.tw/UploadImg/6/0e7af8490500450c972483f0dfc89c84.jpg","URLDisplay":"http://www.riverfarm.org.tw/","FBUrl":"","ContactPerson":"","OpenTimeList":[]}]
