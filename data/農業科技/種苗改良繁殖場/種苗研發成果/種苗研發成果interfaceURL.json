    "英文摘要": "The projects of this program have ttwo components including:\n1.Molecular identification of tomato genotype resistant to Fusarium oxysporum: tomato fusarium wilt is one of the important fungal disease.The molecular markers linked to fusarium wilt resistant genes I-1 and I-3 have been developed. Specific primer pair I1-A2 was developed to amplify DNA fragment from vary allelic at I-1 locus. A 150 bp DNA fragment was amplified from both resistant and susceptible tomato accessions that corresponding to the presence of I-1 and i-1 alleles.After sequencing of PCR products, G is determined at the nucleotide sequence position no. 80 in resistance tomato accession, where as C is determined in the susceptible tomato accession. The different nucleotide sequence between both of resistance and susceptible tomato accession provide the possibility for development of SNP marker. In addition, the I3-P7-CAPS marker was also developed PCR following restriction enzyme (NsiI) digestion. The 380 bp DNA band was obtained from the tomato accession with resistance genes I-3, however, the susceptible tomato accession with gene i-3 was none band. The results are also confirming the previously study of AVRDC- The World Vegetable Center and other seed companies.\n2.Development of molecular marker linked to tomato mosaic virus (ToMV)resistance: ToMV, a member of Tobamovirus, is one of the important tomato viruses, and ToMV-0, ToMV-1, ToMV-2 are three major ToMV strains. The Tm-1, Tm-2 and Tm-22 genes were also identified for ToMV resistance. In the project, we selected the molecular markers Tm1-CAPS and Tm22-SCAR for Tm-1 and Tm-22 based on AVRDC provided tomato lines,and developed a method for specific detection of ToMV-0, 1, and 2. The results showed that a 550 bp DNA band was obtained of PCR product amplified by molecular marker Tm1-CAPS from resistance genes Tm-1 following restriction enzyme (HaeIII) digestion, however 350 bp DNA band was obtained from susceptibility gene tm-1. The Tm22-SCAR could amplify DNA products 255 bp and 214 bp in length from resistance genes Tm-2 and Tm-22, respectively, however, no product was amplified from the susceptible lines. We has also been established molecular marker could be amplified a 2.2 kb of DNA product from ToMV-0, 1, and 2. Those developed molecular markers could help breeder screening and confirmation disease resistant genotypes in early stage to accelerate the breeding and promotion of disease-resistant tomato lines.\n"

In addition, cultured under different day/nigh temperature and high altitude, the flowering rate of Complex type 4266 could up to 76.7%,and with a better uniformity. The flower of Complex type 4266 also developed more quickly under larger temperature variation or cooler temperature but aborted more easily (in Mei-feng and ChunYang).Meanwhile, Maudiae type 4321 has a ununiformed flowering habit. Due to the result, seems both of their flowering habit do not have directly relationship with temperature. As to the testing of total soluble sugar,the result indicates that flowering in september may raise sugar consumption. From now on, the data showed that the C/N is not sutible for using as Paphiopedilum (plants from seed) flower initiation index.\nIn this study, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were tested in separate experiments, nitrogen and potassium rates were 0, 50, 100, 200,and 400 mg.L-1, phosphorus rates were 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg.L-1.

    "中文摘要": "國內8-11月是有機及鮮食馬鈴薯缺貨的季節，原住民部落可利用海拔高度栽培馬鈴薯，以供應夏季的有機鮮食市場。於高海拔設施栽培可以在梅雨季節開始栽種並於8-9月採收，設施栽培薯球產量比露天栽培多一倍，露天栽培則建議於梅雨季節過後，於9-10月採收。中海拔(700m)栽培馬鈴薯比高海拔(2100m)露天栽培產量來得低，於中海拔地區進行不同克尼伯品系營養系的單株產量大約分佈在145-279公克之間，其中以101A、及101G品系之產量表現為最佳，此外，在原鄉部落收集到2個品系，採集後移至本場溫室栽培，在高溫的環境下可以順利產生種薯。原生豇豆以綠皮的品系1產量最高，建議部落種植時將此品系單一種植或混合其他品系種植，可達到較佳的產量。種植原生豇豆品系，期間並無灌溉、施肥及噴化學藥劑，進行粗放栽培即有產量，為省工栽培的有機產品開發，故原生豇豆有機栽培在原鄉部落是具有可行性的。",
    "英文摘要": "Market is short of organic and fresh potatoes from August to November in Taiwan. Therefore, some aboriginal people can produce potatoes for fresh organic market in summer by taking advantage of higher altitude where they cultivate. People can plant potato in the facility in high land during the rainy season and harvest in August to September, which produce twice as yield as those grown in the open field. It is recommended to begin to plant potatoes in the open field after the rainy season, and harvest in September to October. Additionally, the yield of potato grown in an altitude of 700m in the open field is lower than that in 2100m above the sea level. In the meanwhile, the yield per plant of different Kennebec clones grown in the elevation of 700mwas different between 145 and 279 grams, which clone 101A and 101G had higher yield. Furthermore,we collected 2 potato clones in the tribal homeland and successfully produced tubers after moving to the greenhouse in our station under high temperature environment. In another experiment, native green-skin cowpea strain 1had the highest yield among test strains, and we recommended to plant the strain singled or mixed to get the higher yield when grown in the indigenous tribe area. Planting native strains of cowpea with no irrigation, fertilization and spraying chemicals could successfully harvest pods, which is low input for organic production. So, organic native cowpea cultivation is feasible in the tribal homeland"

Development of standardized sampling and testing of the potato disease potato production processes comply with health applications verified.\nb.The objective of this program is to develop a convenient and effective seed disinfection technique on asparagus bean for decreasing the ratio of seed carrying Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tracheiphilum. This disinfection technique will be helpful for diminishing the transmission and occurrence of the Fusarium wilt of asparagus bean in the fields.The Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. tracheiphilum (FOT) carried by asparagus bean seeds could be transmitted by polluting the seed surface or infecting into seeds. The investigation results showed that the FOT was detected on four asparagus bean cultivars with ratio of 3-25%. Other fungi and bacteria were also detected with high seed-carried ratio, but,after surface disinfection, the ratio of some fungi and bacteria decreased effectively. However, it was still possible that the fungi and bacteria existed in seeds. The result of disinfection with fungicides indicated that the effect of chemicals were not able to be confirmed yet owing to FOT-carried ratio on asparagus seeds were low and not stable.\nc.c-1 Strawberry disease non-pesticide control technology development :research for prevention and treatment of strawberry anthracnose nonpesticide formulations to reduce the amount of chemical pesticides,reducing pesticide residues on human health and the environment and ecology of the risk of harm.

We visit six Oncidium tissue culture factories, to understand the company profile, production processes and plantlets standards in this year. Furthermore, we gather commercially Oncidium TC plantlets to explore the influence of the external traits of plantlets quality, including the number of leaves,root number, plant height, root length, fresh/dry weight. Eight hundred and ten young plantlets were found no significant difference between the number of leaves, root number and root length were have a higher degree of variation, presumably by sub-culture transplant operation. Plant height is still relatively easy and reliable grading standards.Preliminary results suggest that large and medium grades are ready for marketing and management model of the small grade plantlets need further evaluation. On the other hand, we also visited 16 Phalaenopsis tissue culture factories and interviewed with the operators about TC equipment,production processes and plantlets standard shipping. We collected 12 portion of Phalaenopsis Sogo Yukidiam ‘V3’ flasks from 11 TC factories,each with 6 flasks, a total of 72 samples. These in vitro plantlets were followed by qualified survey, calculating the numbers and weights of shoots and roots and then divided into four quality levels. We also took some samples to analyze the implant component, and the remaining plants were moved in a professional orchid nursery until they grew to medium size. The medium plants were also measured and analyzed the same item as in vitro plantlets. These medium plants were classified to four grades according to the analysis. Superior Phalaenopsis plantlets have upright type, normal leaf and root shapes, more than three leaves, two or more valid roots and plant weight is higher than 3 grams. These plants also have moderated leaf nitrogen content (1.5-4% dry weight), high levels of potassium (more than 5% dry weight). 04-0.8% phosphorus dry weight content, the calcium content of less than 0.4% and the magnesium content 0.15% or more.1346 samples of Phalaenopsis tissue culture(TC) seedling collected from 3 orchid nurseries were detected by RT-PCR technique for Odontoglossum ringspot virus(ORSV)and Cymbidium mosaic virus(CymMV).Results showed that 92.8% samples were healthy seedlings"

This study we also merged primer set I2/Fu as Multiplex-PCR through once PCR, detecting I-2, i-2 andFusarium oxysporum simultaneously. Primer I2/Fu could amplify resistance genes I-2\n0.7 or 0.8 kb, susceptibility gene i-2 2.2 kb and Fusarium spp. 1.0 kb of DNA bands. The molecular markers could help breeders early screening and confirmation disease resistant plant genotypes, helping to accelerate the breeding and promotion of disease-resistant tomato lines.\nUsing seven cauliflower lines which are commonly used breeding parental as test material. To do SCAR primers screening based on Brace’s PCRrestriction classification test results that established in 1994. The result of PCR-restriction classification in addition to the line SP04 and SP06 are same self-incompatibility genotype, the other are different.Then the SCAR makers screening results showed that there are two sets of SCAR primers: D4-1 * D7-2 can identify lines SP01, SP04/SP06, SP08; K1-2 * K4-4 can identify lines SP07, SP08, SP09, SP10.\nTobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a serious constraint to the production,often causing 100% yield loss. In the world, the disese is caused by three strains, TMV-0, TMV-1, TMV-2. The main disease resistance genes identified include Tm-1, Tm-2 and Tm-2 2. In this study, we have developed the method of molecular markers with AVRDC for specific detection of TMV,and molecular markers for resistance genes Tm-2. The results showed we has been established molecular marker, TMV, could be amplified tobacco mosaic virus 2.2 kb of DNA band. Primer Tm2 could amplify resistance genes Tm-2 650 bp and susceptibility gene tm-2 450 bp of DNA bands. The molecular markers could help breeders early screening and confirmation disease resistant plant genotypes (R / R, R / S, S / S), helping to accelerate the breeding and promotion of disease-resistant tomato lines.\n"

Three dendrobium cultivars divided into four groups according to maturation stage and plant height. The results indicated that plant height, node number, leaf number, shoot fresh/dry weight, seedling index and maturity were no obvious correlated, but water content was increasing in the mature plants. Nitrogen content was affected by species, organs, and cultivated conditions, hence the carbon/nitrogen ration would not appropriate maturation index. As to PGR treatments, the plants are still not blooming. But the results indicated that the application of BA increased the number of leaves and axillary buds. And the application of GA increased the plant height and axillary buds , but decreased number of leaves, especially in variety 128. BA can neutralize the leaf-falling effect against GA. The TDZ was also tested,the preliminary experimental results indicated TDZ contribute to large amount of flower buds formation. However, the buds had very high rate of deadth and blasting rather than bloom normally. In addition, if the concentration was higher, the rate of blasting was higher."

    "英文摘要": "Virus and pathogen detection and establishment of mother-stock garden is the fundamental of healthy seedling production. In this program, we will implement the developing pathogen validation system and construction mother-stock garden to maintain specific pathogen free mother-stock such as potato, grapes, strawberry and bamboo etc. Our results indicated grapes, strawberry and bamboo kept in mother-stock garden were not infected by specific pathogens. Potato stocks were infected by potato virus S or potato virus Y and using none certification potato seed tube would face higher infection risk. We hope this effort could support healthy seedling production in Taiwan.\nTo refer to the scientific or technical literature, we completed the detection technology inventory of Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus, CCYV and Strawberry latent ringspot virus, SLRSV. The main detection technologies of CCYV are RT-PCR,Western blotting,ELISA and Immunoelectron microscopy. The main detection technologies of SLRSV are RT-PCR, IC-RT-PCR, ELISA and pathognomy. By taking different samples to test the detection technology, we choose RT-PCR for CCYV and ELISA for SLRSV to be the most suitable detectoion method. And we establish standard testing process (SOP), and finish the ability to test.\nThe objective of this program is to establish the seed testing procedure on Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) which causes black rot of crucifers. The procedure in coincidence with ISTA rules has been established. Artificial infested seeds were adopted to check the Xcc testing procedure. Xcc showed pale green and pale yellow mucoid colonies individually on FS and mCS20ABN selective media. And the Xcc-carried ratio of 0.01% could be detected in sensitivity test. No Xcc was detected in 7 lots of crucifer seeds from different producers. The documents for\nquality management had also been completed.\nOne required index of high quality of seed/seedling is genetic purity,especially for hybrid seed. Genetic purity in a commercial hybrid of solanaceous crops is very important. This year, we setup this quality control mode by using molecular markers in seed production system of the crops of tomato and pepper, last two year we did some part work in tomato and pepper. The year, We obtain six new sets of SCAR primer for three specific DNA fragments in tomato and ten new sets of SCAR primer for six specific DNA fragments in pepper, they can identify hybrid from parents.The SCAR primer can have the sharp and easy-read DNA fragment after PCR amplification and electrophoresis. We will collect these SCAR primers as members of data base for testing F1 hybrid seed purity in tomato and pepper.\n"

Some added substances such as sulfur dioxide,6-BA or 2,4-D were detected. We also found out the rate of fungal and bacterial contamination of commercially available green bean seeds were 42% and 24% respectively. After 30 minutes heat treatment at 70℃, the contaminated seeds changed into clean effectively and did not affect the germination. We established a safe sprouts production processes by growth enviroment control and sprouts cultivated pressurized containers and sprouts rootscutting machine. This project advised a professional grower to produce safe sprouts without chemical or plant growth regulator. According to our survey at major potato production areas in Taiwan, common scab disease was decreased 55% by using certified seed potato. It shows that using healthy seed potato can avoid the risk of common scab disease. Compared non-pesticidal and non-fungicidial management with traditional management, the yield and quality of seed potato were no significant difference. The result shows that we can reduce the risk of using chemistry by non-pesticidal and non-fungicidial management. And we also recommend using 1000x the period of cultivation to get better seed potato.The results of preliminary experience show that the virus-free seedlings of 7 Asparagus been varieties planting in net house, there seemed significant differences in seed yield.sparagus bean (yard-long bean) varieties and one fusarium-resistant stock were tested in the study to evaluate the resistance of fusarium wilt in the field.The results showed of plant survival rate of seed seedlings and grafted asparagus bean planted in production field at 4th continuous cropping were 0% and 82% ,respectively.

The future goal is to make Taiwan as the Asia-Pacific Plant Seedling Centre, which constructed for the export market-oriented. \nTo construct the healthy seedling procedure management system is one of the nucleus strategies to make Taiwan as the Asia-Pacific Plant Seedling Centre.\nTSS starts to construct the whole R ＆ D production procedure of health seedling, healthy seed production system process control and industrial applications.And TSS also make connection and meet the demands of the international validation and certification system.\nThe Netherlands is internationally renowned for its practical approaches and applications in the seedling industry since the first bulb test laboratory was set up. Cooperation between public (Plant Protection Service, PD) and private sectors (including: Netherlands Inspection Service for Horticulture；Naktuinbouw, NAKT; Flower Bulb Inspection Service, BKD; Dutch General Inspection Service for Agricultural Seed) has resulted in innovative developments in breeding and variety development,seed production, storage, seed certification and marketing. The Dutch approach to seed sector development and worldwide partnerships provide new insights and knowledge for the sustainable development of seedling supply systems in developing countries or countries with an economy in transition.\nIn Taiwan, in order to prevent the spread of pests, to assist producers in improving the quality of plant seeds, seedlings and their products,and to protect the consumers’ interests, the guidelines are hereby established by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (hereinafter called BAPHIQ) for setting up the system to verify the pests free status of plant seeds and seedlings for decades.The crops include Oncidium, green bamboo, bean (Vigna unguiculata),citrus, potatoes, sweet potatoes and orchids. Government uses this kind of system to supply the healthy seedling to the beginning source of the production procedure as encourage and help the farmers in adopting healthy seedlings.\nNowaday the certification and validation of healthy seeding production system in Taiwan still focus at the period of the growing period. Take potato seed production as an example to compare the differences between Taiwan and Netherland.\nThe strategy of production procedure (fig.2) and the management of production procedure of NAK of Netherland are different from seedling production in Taiwan. The system of the postharvest management (table 1.), the lot management and the trace system of certification of potato seeding in Netherland are well established which we do not have such system in Taiwan.

The first is the establishment and application molecular markers of the resistance to sport wilt virus in tomato analysis system. Specific markers SCAR-Sw5-1313 and SCAR-sw 5-676 were developed for differentiating allelic variation at Sw5 locus. It amplifies fragments from both resistant and susceptible tomato accessions with different molecular sizes that corresponding to the presence of Sw5/Sw5, Sw5/sw5 and sw5/sw5 alleles.This year we also merged SCAR-Sw 5-1313, SCAR-sw 5-676 and TSWV as Multiplex-PCR through once RT-PCR, detecting Sw5/Sw5, Sw5/sw5, sw5/sw5 and TSWV simultaneously. Sw5a and Sw5b are resistance genes to sport wilt\nvirus in chromosome 9 of tomato. Genes (Sw 5a and Sw 5b) could be\nidentified by molecular markers Tss#Sw5a and Tss#Sw5b, respectively. F2 segregation rate of Sw5aSw5b /Sw5aSw5b, Sw5aSw5b/sw5 and sw5/sw5 was 1:2:1. Inoculation experiment of TSWV to 2 F2 populations showed superiority of homo-resistance genotype and hetero-resistance genotype to susceptibility genotype.\nThe second is establishment the molecular markers for sex determination in Carica papaya L. (papaya) by using SSR and SCAR analysis. In SSR-PCR and SCAR-PCR analysis, we didn't found the maker was specific to allhermaphrodite character. Most of these primers can get a band in male,hermaphrodite and all-hermaphrodite materials. The sequence analysis results of the band were showed single nucleotide differences in male/hermaphrodite or hermaphrodite/ all-hermaphrodite materials. These single nucleotide differences might be applied to SNP or CAPS molecular markers which can detected the all-hermaphrodite character. But it is needed further experimental results to prove it. \nTomato yellow leaf curl disease is a serious constraint to the production, often causing 100% yield loss. In Taiwan, the disese is caused by the monopartite Tomato leaf curl Taiwan virus (ToLCTWV) and the bipartite Tomato yellow leaf curl Thailand virus (TYLCTHV). The main disease resistance genes identified include Ty-1, 2, 3,,3a, 4 and 5. In this study, we have developed the method with AVRDC for specific detection of TYLCTHV and ToLCTWV, and molecular markers for resistance genes Ty-3a and Ty-5. The results showed we has been established BGVs,TY-TH, TY-TW molecular marker could be amplified Begomovirus, ToLCTWV and TYLCTHV virus 1.6 kb of DNA band. Primer Ty3 could amplify resistance genes Ty-3 and Ty-3a 320 bp and 500 bp and susceptibility gene ty-3 250 bp of DNA bands. Resistance gene Ty-5 and susceptibility gene ty-5 could be amplified by Ty5 molecular marker 750 bp and 650 bp of DNA bands. The molecular markers could help breeders early screening and confirmation disease resistant plant genotypes (R / R, R / S, S / S), helping to accelerate the breeding and promotion of disease-resistant tomato lines.\n"

This year,regarding TAF-certification for laboratory equipment, design and layout of the laboratory has already been completed and laboratory bench and instruments have been acquired, calibrated and approved for operations.Second purpose of this plan, with reference to published literature,detection methods for Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus, CCYV and Strawberry latent ringspot virus, SLRSV have been researched and cataloged. Current detection methods regarding Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus, CCYV include: RT-PCR, Western blotting, ELISA, and Immunoelectron microscopy; for Strawberry latent ringspot virus, SLRSV, current detection methods include: RT-PCR, IC-RT-PCR, ELISA as well as symptom diagnosis. Utilizing various detecting methods on different samples, the most suitable detection method will be chosen as the standard detection procedure. One required index of high quality of seed/seedling is genetic purity, especially for hybrid seed. Genetic purity in a commercial hybrid of solanaceous crops is very important. This year, we setup this quality control mode by using molecular markers in seed production system of the crops of tomato and pepper, last year we did some part work in tomato. We obtain seven sets of SCAR primer for six specific DNA fragments in tomato and ten sets of SCAR primer for six specific DNA fragments in pepper,they can identify hybrid from parents. The SCAR primer can have the sharp and easy-read DNA fragment after PCR amplification and electrophoresis.We will collect these SCAR primers as members of data base for testing F1 hybrid seed purity in tomato and pepper till year 2013. Last object of this program is for the ISTA accreditation on the seed testing of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) which causes black rot of crucifers. The Xcc testing procedure which conforms to ISTA rules has been established. Artificial infested seeds were adopted to check the Xcc testing procedure. On FS and mCS20ABN selective media, Xcc showed individully pale green and pale yellow mucoid colonies. The cabbage leaves that were stab-inoculated with Xcc showed typical yellowing necrotic V-shaped symptoms in pathogenicity test. The Xcc-carried ratio of 0.02% could be detected in sensitivity test."

The treatments of thirty and above minutes with 45°C hot water obviously decreased the Xv-carried ratio of artificial infested sweet pepper seeds. The treatment of ten minutes with 50°C hot water could totally disinfect the Xv on artificial infested sweet pepper seeds and, meanwhile, that did not reduce the germination rate. In the trial of varied bactericides, the treatment with 0.6% sodium chloride showed the best disinfection on artificial infested sweet pepper seeds,and the treatment with Kasugamycin and copper oxychloride could effectively reduce Xv-carried ratio and even thoroughly disinfect the artificial infested sweet pepper seeds without diminishing the germination rate.\nc. 外銷蔬菜種子品質提升技術研究 (委辦)\nThe objective of this study was to establish a disinfection method for seeds of Crucifer vegetables for preventing black rot disease caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestri (XCC).

Those seeds were first contaminated with Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestri (XCC1-1) before disinfection treatments including ‘ 30 seconds of 3% H2O2 followed by heated dry at 70oC for 40 min’, ‘heated at 70oC for 7 days’, ‘hot ZnSO4’ , and the seeds were storage at electronic dry cabinet. The germination rate was maintained rather constant at 96% for 6 months of monthly check, which indicated that seed germination did not significantly influence by all the treatments. For the XCC1-1 disinfection, the treatment of ‘heated at 70oC for 7 days’ was the best for the seeds’ wash-through remained 0 detection for 6 months of monthly check. The results of the other 2 treatments were not as complete and constant. Therefore, we concluded that ‘heated the seeds at 70oC for 7 days’ was a valuable methods, which is simple and easy to apply to large amount of seeds.

But the higher rooting rates of Ficus formosana Maxim. need more time.\nIn germination test of Taiwan goldenrain tree and Light sacrificial tree seeds, the results of germination rates demonstrated that there was no significant difference between seeds accepted water soaking for one day and those with no soaking treatment whether seeding in soil or in peat moss mix. The averaged plant height of Taiwan goldenrain tree seedlings which germinated in 128-cell plug with peatmoss mix was significantly\nhigher than the result with soil medium. The performance of Taiwan goldenrain tree seedlings grown in 24-cell plug with peat moss mix was better than those with soil medium. It was also the same in the result of seedlings grown in 4.5-inch plastic bags. After transplanting to 6-inch pots from 4.5-inch pots or 24-cell plug , the performance of plant\nheight, leaf number, stem diameter, the number of roots longer than 10 cm and root weight of plants grown in peat moss mix was better than those in soil medium. In the stage of 128-cell plug seedlings, the leaf number of Light sacrificial tree seedlings grown in soil medium was more than those in peat moss mix. The averaged plant heights of both treatments were not significantly different. In the stage of 24-cell plug or 4.5-inch plastic bag seedlings, the performance of seedlings grown in soil medium was\nbetter than those in peat moss mix.\nTwo intergenerational Kennebec varieties of potato subculture Plant growth and tuber production are not significantly difference. But four intergenerational subculture of tuber production are significantly difference by the environmental impact of difference planting time. 19 pot chrysanthemum varieties collected in this study were tested for virus infection percentage . The results indicated that CAB virus, 25% infection percentage, was the mainly one infected in chrysanthemum plants, and virus-free plants were isolated and raised for stock plants.The leaf size and internode length were smaller in high temperature treatment (38/25℃) than in control treatment (25/18℃), and the scion\nquality was also reduced in high temperature condition. In the fertilizer treatment, Peters 30-10-10 treatment got more flowers than other treatments, however, 20-20-20 and 15-10-30 treatment had more cuttings.\n"

    "中文摘要": "一、重要有機種子生產國制度研究\n1.本計畫位瞭解部前國內有機種苗供需雙方的現狀以及意見，進行問卷調查。經驗証有機農場部分發函件回收39件。種苗業者部分分發函件回收17件。\n2.整體而言，約83%的有機農家有在自行留種作業，沒有者17%。水稻秧苗自備者僅18%，向外面購買秧苗者82%；其中買到有機秧苗約36%，買不到有機秧苗71%有向驗證單位報告。有機農家外購雜糧種苗時60%有指定「有機種苗」。指定「有機種苗」，可買到的農家有42%，買不到的有58%。外購雜糧種苗時68%有指定「無農藥處理」。約44%的農家表示買到經藥劑處理的種子；其中有一半未向驗證單位報告。覆函的問卷中，就全部蔬菜種苗而言，自行採種留種的部分佔31%，與其他農友交換所得來的佔12%，外購種苗佔57%。外購種苗沒有一家能購買到有機種苗，而購買到的種苗中約三分之二沒有經過化學藥劑處理(41%)，約三分之一有經過藥劑處理(16%)。無法購到未經藥劑處理的蔬菜作物種子，只能買到經藥劑處理的種子時，有63%有事先向驗證單位報告，37%未事先報告。\n3.政府有機農法目前對種苗的規範，有48%的有農家認為合理。認為不合理者有52%。有23%認為政府應該強制規定須使用有機生產的種苗，若無法購買，則可以使用非有機生產，但絕對不可以經農藥處理的種苗。大體同前述的意見，但不得以主張可以用經農藥處理種苗者，有35.9%。有25.6%認為不需強制使用有機種苗，但絕對不可以經農藥處理的種苗。\n4.種苗業者僅6%有在國內販賣有機種苗，但有接受到詢問的業者有41%。未有出口有機種苗者，有接受到國外詢問的業者僅12%。有在進行採種工作的業者，並無一個在國內外進行有機採種，但有35%接到國內詢問，17%接到國外詢問。有意願嚐試在國內進行有機採種者有24%，在海外採種者有17%。若政府成立有機種苗資料庫，有65%業者願意提供資料。\n二、蔬菜種子有機種衣劑及添加物之開發\n以高嶺土與麥飯石及滑石粉與皂土依100:0、25:75、75:25及0:100等不同比例混合披衣於油菜種子，以100:0的高嶺土：麥飯石及0:100的高嶺土：麥飯石粉在紙上法皆為98%，砂床法為93%，田間萌芽率96%，與對照組無顯著差異。未披衣種子平均發芽日數為1.0天，顯著低於各處理，經披衣處理者，以100%高嶺土處理者為1.7天最低。以珍珠石粉為披衣基質添加機能性材質在十字花科種子披衣處理中，添加甲殼素及竹碳粉不影響披衣種子紙上法發芽率。添加不同機能性材質對油菜幼苗生育影響差異不顯著；在結球白菜上添加木徽菌、蘇力菌及甲殼素能提高其鮮重、乾重、莖長及莖徑；在甘藍上，經披衣處理者其幼苗生長皆較未披衣處理者高；花椰菜添加蘇力菌及苦茶粕對鮮重有顯著增加，乾重及莖長則各有高低，莖徑經披衣處理者皆較未披衣者高。各處理間對黑斑病之罹病效果不顯著。試驗中所用之添加物皆為市售商品化之產品，其濃度較高，未來朝向不同稀釋比例期能減少添加物對種子發芽影響。在茄科作物披衣處理試驗上，以高嶺土與滑石粉50:50之比例及SA在番茄及辣椒在各種發芽率表現上最為穩定，添加其他膠類雖表現對辣椒無明顯差異，來年將以及SA配方之底衣液為基礎，添加各機能性材質，期能對番茄幼苗生長有所助益。\n",
    "英文摘要": "In Taiwan, about 83% of the certified organic farms experience seed\nsaving activities. Bur in organic rice producers only 18% grew their own\nseedlings in their farm, those purchased from outside only 36% acquired\norganic rice seedlings. Those purchased seeds of other field crops from\noutside only 25% acquired organic seeds. In organic vegetable production,\n31% farms grew their own seeds, 12% got seeds from other organic farm.\nThere were 57% organic vegetable producers acquired seeds from seed\ncompanies, none of them were organic seeds. Forty-eight percent organic\nfarmers were satisfied with current organic regulations on seeds\nrequirements. Twenty-three percent organic farmers favoured regulations\nthat designate the use of organic seeds. Only 6% of seed/seedling\nsuppliers sold organic seeds/seedlings; 41% suppliers received enquires of organic seeds domestically, 17% received enquires from abroad. None of the investigated seed producers produced organic seeds. As high as 65% seed/seedling suppliers interested in joining a organic seeds database.By using the rate of 100:0, 25:75, 75:25, 0:100 kaolinite and maifan stone, talc and bentonite coated on the rape seed. The germination rate of pure kaolinite and maifan stone were 98% on top paper, 93% on sand,and 96% on field emerge germination method, which were not significant different with other treatment. In average germination day, the noncoated treatment were significant lower then other treatment, 1.0 day. In the coated seeds, coated with pure kaolinite were 1.7day. The Cruciferae\nseed coated with perlite powder and added functional materials on coated treatment, the germination rate were not significant different with chitosan and bamboo bio-carbon powder except broccoli added bamboo biocarbon powder by using the top paper. There were not significant different on rape seedling that coating added with functional materials.\nThe fresh weight, dry weight, stem length and stem diameter increased in Chinese cabbage seedling that coating added with trichoderma, Bacillus thuringiensis, chitosan. The cabbage seedling that coated treatment were higher then without coated. The fresh weight increase significant on added Bacillus thuringiensis., and tea seed pomace. The Cruciferae coated with functional materials were not significant difference on black rot.\nIn this experiment, the coated addition were all commercial production. In the future, we will try to change the concentration of addition to decrease the germination effect. In the Solanaceae coating material, the kaolinite and maifan stone mix ratio 50:50 and SA liquid were suitable for tomato and hot pepper. Base on this formula, we will try to add some functional materials to increase the organic coated seed function for organic culture in the future.\n"

    "中文摘要": "為獲得穩定的仙履蘭炭疽病菌(C. gloeosporioides)的接種源，已合成一個能有效促進產胞的培養基。針對仙履蘭炭疽病菌對蘭科或非蘭科寄主的專一性，得知該菌可為害蝴蝶蘭、嘉得利亞蘭、國蘭及文心蘭等蘭科植物，但不會為害非蘭科的作物。評估仙履蘭四品種對炭疽病的抗感性，結果顯示四品種均可被此病原感染，其中以iveum x sib和Hung Sheng Glow x Incantation雜交後裔最為感病。測試七種精油對仙履蘭炭疽病菌生長之影響，結果顯示草果與冬青精油抑菌的效果最佳。網室評估三種不同精油配方防治炭疽病菌的效果，結果顯示施用AF1-99配方配合撲克拉錳(6000倍)的防治的效果比單獨施用AF1-99配方或撲克拉錳的防治效果較佳。網室評估四支木黴菌防治炭疽病菌的效果，結果顯示T. viride與 T. harzianum兩支木黴菌可有效降低炭疽病的發生率。為達到早期病害檢測之目標，本試驗針對仙履蘭炭疽病菌設計專一性引子對90F/328R：(3'-GAC TTT GAA ATG CGA CTA CAG-5')/ (3'- GCC TTG CGA CGG AAC ATG GCG-5')可專一性偵測仙履蘭炭疽病菌，於300 bp可擴增一特異性條帶。進一步利用孢子懸浮液、菌株以及健康植株與菌株DNA不同混合比例，測試此專一性引子對之靈敏度。結果指出，於孢子濃度約100顆孢子/μl，或菌株DNA濃度約1 ng/μl，或植菌比為50：1，皆可有效檢測出仙履蘭炭疽病菌。",
    "英文摘要": "In order to obtain a stable inocula of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, a medium was formulated for enhancing sporulation of C. gloeosporioides. Orchid or nonorchid plants were inoculated to etermine host specificity of C. gloeosporioides. C.gloeosporioides was mainly pathogenic on Phalaenopsis, Cattleya, Cymbidium and Oncidium orchids. Four cultivars of Paphiopedilum were evaluated for their response to C . gloeosporioides. Among four cultivars tested, two hybrid descendants niveum x siband and Hung Sheng Glow x Incantation were the most susceptible. Seven essential oils were investigated for their antifungal activities on C. gloeosporioides. Essential oils obtained from Amomum tsao-ko and Ilex were the most effective for suppressing mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides. Three essential oil formulations were studied their antifungal activities on C.gloeosporioides in greenhouse. Results showed combination of AF1-99 oil formula and prochloraz manganese (6000 times) was the most effective for controlling the incidence of anthracnose disease, compared with AF1-99 formula alone or prochloraz manganese (6000 times) alone. In greenhouse experiment, four isolates of Trichoderma were tested for their abilities for control of anthracnose.Among four Trichoderma isolates tested, T. viride and T. harzianum effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose disease. A set of specific primers, 90F/328R:(3’-GAC TTT GAA ATG CGA CTA CAG-5’)/ (3’- GCC TTG CGA CGG AAC ATG GCG -5’), was desiged to amplify a portion of the β-tubulin gene for the detection of C. gloeosporioides from slipper orchid. Results showed that a DNA fragment of about 300 bp was only amplified in slipper orchid, not in C.gloeosporioides from other crops. The primers sensitivity were assessed further by using different spore suspension(10000, 2000, 1000, 200, 100, 50, 1 spores/􀂵l), different fungal DNA(10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 ng/􀂵l), and ratio of plant DNA: fungal DNA(0：1、5：1、10：1、50：1、100：1、150：1、200：1、250：1、300：1 、1：0). The sensitivity using the specific primers was 100 spores/􀂵l suspension,1 ng/􀂵l DNA or ratio of 50:1(plant DNA: fungal DNA), respectively."

    "中文摘要": "球根花卉品種選育在彩色海芋方面，94及95年雜交後裔中已選出具潛力單株30株。孤挺花方面，從10個單株中獲得具潛力單株4株，分別是H911002、H912002、H922005及H921001，經量化繁殖比較試驗則以H911002繁殖倍率較高。蘭花品種選育方面，以蝴蝶蘭雜交後裔之小苗出瓶數量、死亡數、葉幅、葉片數等，作為初步篩選優良雜交組合之依據，共調查22個雜交組合，以P96057雜交組合最佳。在耐寒試驗篩選方面四個蝴蝶蘭雜交組合中。以P95040之雜交組合較具耐寒性。拖鞋蘭選育中，以短梗亞屬及多花亞屬當父本雜交各個不同亞屬種類當母本之拖鞋蘭雜交後裔比較，結果以P .bellatulum當父本，P. henryanum及P. liemianum當母本之平均葉片數及葉寬較多。\n在建立蕙蘭健康種苗驗證體系試驗方面，調查南投地區7家蕙蘭栽培業者，採樣12品種計119株，在嘉義地區調查5家業者，採樣6品種計46株，發現以錦旗、瑞梅跟大勳3品種之病毒發生率較高，為23.08%、50%及33.33%；其餘品種如玉花、太平洋、神童等，則無病毒檢出。利用培養基法測試七種精油對木黴菌與蝴蝶蘭黃葉病菌生長之影響，得知草果與冬\n青兩精油，可有效抑制蝴蝶蘭黃葉病菌的生長，但不會抑制木黴菌的生長。將上述具有抑菌的精油，依不同的比例混合成精油配方，然後進行培養基法測試不同經油配方對蝴蝶蘭黃葉病菌生長之影響，結果顯示AF1-99配方使蝴蝶蘭黃葉病菌的生長明顯受抑制。網室評估不同精油配方防治黃葉病菌的效果，結果顯示施用AF1-99配方配合撲克拉錳的防治的效果比單獨施用AF1-99配方或撲克拉錳的防治效果較佳。網室評估木黴菌防治黃葉病菌的效果，結果顯示木黴菌混拌至水草的防治的效果比覆蓋木黴菌的防治效果較佳。\n",
    "英文摘要": "We have selected 30 potential hybrid progenies during in 2005 and 2006 hybrid of calla lily, and compared 4 potential hybrid progenies,including H911002, H912002, H922005 and H921001of amaryllis for bulk propagation. H911002 is the best for bulk propagation. We also have evaluated 22 hybrid progenies from the different horticultural characteristics in phalaenopsis. P96057 is the best hybrid combination.\nP .bellatulum as pollen parent and P. henryanum or P. liemianum as motherparent is the best combination for leaf numbers and leaf width in hybridprogenies.\nIn order to establish the healthy propagation system, we checked seven cymbidium’s farms in Nan-Tao about 119 plants including 12 varieties and 46 plants including 6 varieties in Chai-Yi. We found higher CymMV and ORSV virus infection in ‘Ching-Chi’，’Rei-Mei’ and ’Dai-Hsin’ varities.\nSeven essential oils were investigated for their antifungal activities on Fusarium solani and Trichoderma spp. Essential oils obtained from Amomum tsao-ko and Ilex suppressed more effective in mycelial growth of F.solani and less in that of Trichoderma spp. Essential oils with antifungal activities were used to develop different formulations to confirm their antifungal activity. AF1-99 formula (1000 times) significantly inhibited mycelial growth of F. solani. Two isolates of Trichoderma were examined for their sensitivity to prochloraz manganese (6000 times) fungicide. Results showed that the response of two\nTrichoderma isolates grown on prochloraz manganese-amended culture media were resistant. Three essential oil formulations were studied their antifungal activities on C. gloeosporioides in greenhouse. Results showed combination of AF1-99 oil formula and prochloraz manganese (6000 times) was the most effective for controlling the incidence of anthracnose disease, compared with AF1-99 formula alone or prochloraz manganese (6000\ntimes) alone. Mixing of Trichoderma inoculation into the sphagnum moss was effective for control of F. solani compared with Trichoderma mulch in greenhouse experiments. richoderma mulch had no negative effect on growth of root of Phalaenopsis, whereas mix of Trichodema into the sphagnum moss did inhibit the growth of root.\n"
